Introduction
------------

NPFS is a classic UNIX-style inode-based filesystem, implemented
using FUSE. Try it; it works!

You can build the program as follows:
	$ make test TEST=fuse_wrappers.c

The FUSE test becomes much easier to debug like this, as it will run
in the foreground and display error messages:
	$ ./npfsd -f -s /mnt &

Modules
-------

* fs 		Creating and mounting the filesystem
* inode		The inode table and file I/O
* dir		Root directory
* filedes	File descriptor table (only maintains state)
* blkio		Wrappers around the disk emulator
* sfs_api.c	Calls functions in these modules


Implementation Notes
--------------------

Clang's -fsanitize=address does not identify any problems in *my* 
code, and I've been very meticulous about the design as well.

The rather odd filesystem format was specified for this assignment
and I did not change it except where necessary to make things work.

Files in the root directory were provided for the implementation of
the assignment and are somewhat modified.
